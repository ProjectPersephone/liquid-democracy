To make life easier for people when using PostgreSQL we can install PGAdmin3, following the steps:

1) Open the terminal
2) Do a cleaning
   $ sudo apt-get autoremove
3) Install PGAdmin3

To access just access the Dash by pressing the "windows" key and typing "pgadmin".
After accessing PGAdmin3 we need to configure it to access PostgreSQL.

1) On the home screen click on the picture of a "plug" that has a "Add connection to a server" hint that will open a form called "New Server Registration"

2) Fill in the following fields

Name: liquid-democracy
Host: localhost

(the other fields leave the default value)

3) In the "Object Browser" on the left there is "Server Groups", so just click on the "+" to be able to browse the server

4) Click on "Server Groups> Servers> liquid-democracy> Databases (3)> postgres" and then on the task bar in "SQL" to open the PGAdmin query editor

-- App Role CREATE ROLE app_liquid_democracy

  LOGIN PASSWORD 'app_liquid_democracy';
  
-- DBA Role
  CREATE ROLE dba
  LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'dba'
  CREATEROLE CREATEDB;
  
-- Development Database
  CREATE DATABASE dev_liquid_democracy
    OWNER app_liquid_democracy;
-- Test Database
  CREATE DATABASE test_liquid_democracy
    OWNER app_liquid_democracy;
    
6) Close the query editor without saving the script and in the Object Browser select the server 'liquid-democracy', right click and "Disconnect Server"

7) After disconnecting from the server, right click again and select "Properties" and in the form change the following fields:

Username: app_liquid_democracy

Okay, now your PGAdmin is configured to access PostgreSQL.
