Attempting to create a new Area, I got this

java.io.IOException: tmpFile.renameTo(classFile) failed

... and a long stack trace. Trying to solve this problem,
I ran across this possible fix: remove Macafee protection.

"Fast forward four years to 2014. Tomcat 8, Java 8, Windows 8,
same error. After half a day of frustration it turns out to be
caused by my antivirus software, which in my case was McAfee.
I went extreme and uninstalled the whole thing. But there was
probably some setting I could have made to exclude the Tomcat
directories from live scanning."
